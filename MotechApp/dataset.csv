"Welcome to Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. Natural language processing is the
area of study dedicated to the automatic manipulation of speech and text by software. It is
an old field of study, originally dominated by rule-based methods designed by linguists, then
statistical methods, and, more recently, deep learning methods that show great promise in the
field. So much so that the heart of the Google Translate service uses a deep learning method, a
topic that you will learn more about in this book.
I designed this book to teach you step-by-step how to bring modern deep learning models to
your own natural language processing projects.",deep learning
"Natural Language Processing Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software. The study of natural language processing has been around for more than 50 years and grew out of the field of linguistics with the rise of computers. In this chapter, you will discover what natural language processing is and why it is so important. After reading this chapter, you will know:  What natural language is and how it is different from other types of data.  What makes working with natural language so challenging.  Where the field of NLP came from and how it is defined by modern practitioners. Let’s get started. 1.1 Natural Language Natural language refers to the way we, humans, communicate with each other. Namely, speech and text. We are surrounded by text. Think about how much text you see each day:  Signs  Menus  Email  SMS  Web Pages  and so much more... The list is endless. Now think about speech. We may speak to each other, as a species, more than we write. It may even be easier to learn to speak than to write. Voice and text are how we communicate with each other. Given the importance of this type of data, we must have methods to understand and reason about natural language, just like we do for other types of data.",natural language processing

" The Machine Learning Landscape
When most people hear “Machine Learning,” they picture a robot: a dependable butler or a deadly
Terminator depending on who you ask. But Machine Learning is not just a futuristic fantasy, it’s already
here. In fact, it has been around for decades in some specialized applications, such as Optical Character
Recognition (OCR). But the first MLapplication that really became mainstream, improving the lives of
hundreds of millions of people, took over the world back in the 1990s: it was the spam filter. Not exactly
a self-aware Skynet, but it does technically qualify as Machine Learning (it has actually learned so well
that you seldom need to flag an email as spam anymore). It was followed by hundreds of MLapplications
that now quietly power hundreds of products and features that you use regularly, from better
recommendations to voice search.
Where does Machine Learning start and where does it end? What exactly does it mean for a machine to
learn something? If I download a copy of Wikipedia, has my computer really “learned” something? Is it
suddenly smarter? In this chapter we will start by clarifying what Machine Learning is and why you may
want to use it.
Then, before we set out to explore the Machine Learning continent, we will take a look at the map and
learn about the main regions and the most notable landmarks: supervised versus unsupervised learning,
online versus batch learning, instance-based versus model-based learning. Then we will look at the
workflow of a typical MLproject, discuss the main challenges you may face, and cover how to evaluate
and fine-tune a Machine Learning system.
This chapter introduces a lot of fundamental concepts (and jargon) that every data scientist should know
by heart. It will be a high-level overview (the only chapter without much code), all rather simple, but you
should make sure everything is crystal-clear to you before continuing to the rest of the book. So grab a
coffee and let’s get started!",machine learning
"Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.
Here is a slightly more general definition:
[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being
explicitly programmed.
Arthur Samuel, 1959
And a more engineering-oriented one:
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some
performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
Tom Mitchell, 1997
For example, your spam filter is a Machine Learning program that can learn to flag spam given examples
of spam emails (e.g., flagged by users) and examples of regular (nonspam, also called “ham”) emails. The
examples that the system uses to learn are called the training set. Each training example is called a
training instance (or sample). In this case, the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is
the training data, and the performance measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use the ratio
of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called accuracy and it is often
used in classification tasks.
If you just download a copy of Wikipedia, your computer has a lot more data, but it is not suddenly better
at any task. Thus, it is not Machine Learning",machine learning
"Types of Machine Learning Systems
There are so many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to classify them in broad
categories based on:
Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised,
and Reinforcement Learning)
Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning)
Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead detect
patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based
versus model-based learning)
These criteria are not exclusive; you can combine them in any way you like. For example, a state-of-theart spam filter may learn on the fly using a deep neural network model trained using examples of spam and
ham; this makes it an online, model-based, supervised learning system.
Let’s look at each of these criteria a bit more closely.",machine learning
"Machine learning explores 
the study and construction of 
algorithms that can learn 
from and make predictions 
on data. Such algorithms 
operate by building a model 
from example inputs in order 
to make data-driven

Machine learning is closely 
related to computational 
statistics; a discipline that 
aims at the design of 
algorithms for implementing 
statistical methods on 
computers ",machine learning
"Mastering OpenCV 4 with Python will give you the knowledge to build projects
involving Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) and Python.
These two technologies (the first one is a programming language, while the
second one is a computer vision and machine learning library) will be
introduced. Also, you will learn why the combination of OpenCV and Python
has the potential to build every kind of computer application. Finally, an
introduction about the main concepts related to the content of this book will be
provided.
In this chapter, you will be given step-by-step instructions to install everything
you need to start programming with Python and OpenCV. This first chapter is
quite long, but do not worry, because it is divided into easily assimilated
sections, starting with general terminology and concepts, which assumes that the
reader is new to this information. At the end of this chapter, you will be able to
build your first project involving Python and OpenCV.
The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
A theoretical introduction to the OpenCV library
Installing Python OpenCV and other packages
Running samples, documentation, help, and updates

"Face detection
Face detection, which can be defined as the task of determining the location and
size of faces in digital images, is usually the first key step when building face
processing applications (for example, facial expression recognition, drowsiness
detection, gender classification, face recognition, head-pose estimation, or
human-computer interaction). This is because the aforementioned applications
requires as an input the location and size of the detected faces. Therefore,
automatic face detection plays a critical role, and is one of the most studied
topics in the artificial intelligence community.
Face detection seems like an effortless task for a human, but it is a very
challenging task for computers because many problems/challenges are usually
involved (for example, appearance variations, scale, rotation, facial expressions,
occlusion, or lighting condition). Face detection has made impressive progress
after the work proposed by Viola and Jones (https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.1/d7/d8b/tut
orial_py_face_detection.html). In this section, we will see some of the most popular
face detection techniques that the OpenCV library and the dlib and face_processing
packages provide, including the aforementioned Viola and Jones algorithm, and
other machine learning and deep learning approaches.",Python OpenCV
"Face detection with OpenCV
OpenCV provides two approaches for face detection:
Haar cascade based face detectors
Deep learning-based face detectors
The framework proposed by Viola and Jones (see Rapid Object Detection Using
a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features (2001)) is an effective object detection
method. This framework is very popular because OpenCV provides face
detection algorithms based on this framework. Additionally, this framework can
also be used for detecting other objects rather than faces (for example, full body
detector, plate number detector, upper body detector, or cat face detector). In this
section, we will see how to detect faces using this framework.
The face_detection_opencv_haar.py script performs face detection using haar featurebased cascade classifiers. In this sense, OpenCV provides four cascade
classifiers to use for (frontal) face detection:",Python OpenCV
"Face detection with dlib
You can use dlib.get_frontal_face_detector() to create a frontal face detector, which
is based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features and a linear
classifier in a sliding window detection approach. In particular, the HOG trainer
uses a structural SVM-based training algorithm that enables the trainer to train in
all the sub-windows in every training image",Python OpenCV
"Detecting facial landmarks
In computer vision, the localization of the fiducial facial key points (also called
facial landmarks) is usually a key step in a lot of facial analysis methods and
algorithms. Facial expression recognition, head pose estimation algorithms, and
drowsiness detection systems are only a few examples, relying heavily on the
facial shape information provided by the detection of facial landmarks.
A facial landmark detection algorithm aims to automatically identify the
locations of the facial landmark points in images or videos. More specifically,
those key points are either the dominant points that describe the unique location
of a facial component (for example, corners of mouth or eyes) or an interpolated
point that connects those dominant points around the facial components and
facial contour. Formally, given a facial image denoted as I, a landmark detection
algorithm detects the locations of D landmarks x = {x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xD, yD},
where x and y represent the image coordinates of the facial landmarks. In this
section, we are going to see how to detect facial landmarks using both OpenCV
and dlib.",Python OpenCV
"Face tracking
Object tracking tries to estimate the trajectory of the target throughout the video
sequence where only the initial location of a target is known. This task is really
challenging on account of several factors, such as appearance
variations, occlusions, fast motion, motion blur, and scale variations.
In this sense, discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based visual trackers
provide state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, these trackers are
computationally efficient, which is critical in real-time applications. Indeed, the
state-of-the-art performance of DCF-based trackers can be seen in the results of
the visual object tracking (VOT) 2014 Challenge. In the VOT2014 Challenge,
the top three trackers are based on correlation filters.",Python OpenCV
"bject tracking with the dlib DCFbased tracker
The face_tracking_correlation_filters.py script can be modified to track an arbitrary
object. In this case, we will use the mouse to select the object to track. If we
press 1, the algorithm will start tracking the object inside the pre-defined
bounding box. Additionally, if we press 2, the pre-defined bounding box will be
emptied and the tracking algorithm will be stopped, allowing the user to select
another bounding box.
To clarify how the face_tracking_correlation_filters.py script works, we have
included the next two screenshots. In the first one, we can see that we need to
select a bounding box to start the tracking:",Python OpenCV
"Face recognition
With the development of computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning,
face recognition has become a hot topic. Face recognition can be applied to a
wide range of uses, including crime prevention, surveillance, forensic
applications, biometrics, and, more recently, in social networks. Automatic face
recognition has various challenges, such as occlusions, appearance variations,
expression, aging, and scale variations. Following its success with object
recognition, CNNs have been widely used for face recognition.
In this chapter, we will see the functionality that OpenCV offers in connection
with face recognition, and will also explore some deep learning approaches,
which can be easily integrated into your computer vision projects to perform
state-of-the-art face recognition results.",Python OpenCV
"Face recognition with dlib
Dlib offers a high-quality face recognition algorithm based on deep learning.
Dlib implements a face recognition algorithm that offers state-of-the-art
accuracy. More specifically, the model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the labeled
faces in the wild database.
The implementation of this algorithm is based on the ResNet-34 network
proposed in the paper Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (2016),
which was trained using three million faces. T",Python OpenCV
" FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
DESIGN 
Once a Pcore containing the description of the 
hardware accelerator for facial recognition has been 
generated with Vivado-HLS, the next step is the 
design of a hardware platform incorporating it as 
peripheral and the development of a software 
application which makes use of it. ",Python OpenCV
" FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
EVALUATION 
To validate the developed system and to evaluate its 
performance, different tests have been carried out. 
Specifically, two types of tests have been made, one 
with an all-software recognition system, which does 
not include hardware accelerator, and the other with 
the system that includes the hardware accelerator. 
The three implementations of the hardware 
accelerator described in Section 2 have been tested to 
experimentally evaluate how optimizations affect the 
final result. 
We have used two image databases containing 
images of different sizes in order to check the 
acceleration in relation to the size of the matrices to 
be multiplied. One database is the AT&T face 
databases [Att02] (resolution of 92×112 pixels). In 
AT&T database there are 10 grayscale images for 
each of the 40 individuals who compose it. ",Python OpenCV
"Detection of patterns in images using classifiers is one of the most promising topics of research
in the field of computer vision. A large number of practical applications for face detection exist 
and contemporary work even suggests that any specialized detectors can be approximated by 
using fast detection classifiers. In this project, I have developed an algorithm which will detect 
face from the input image with less false detection rate using combined effects of computer 
vision concepts. This algorithm utilizes the concept of recognizing skin color, detecting edges
and extracting different features from face. The result is supported by the statistics obtained 
from calculating the parameters defining the parts of the face. The project also implements the 
highly powerful concept of Support Vector Machine that is used for the classification of images 
into face and non-face class. This classification is based on the training data set and indicators 
of luminance value, chrominance value, saturation value, elliptical value and nose, eye & mouth 
map values",Python OpenCV
"Edge detection
In the edge detection phase, edges of the object from the images are detected using a 
particular threshold value. Using the Gaussian filter the noise from the images is 
filtered out. The next step would involve calculating the intensity gradient of the 
image. This would help eliminate the varying lighting condition. Then the 
morphological operators like elation and dilation are applied which reduces the noise 
from the background image. The non-suppression is applied which helps in removing 
the points that are not part of the edge.
The most important step of this phase is to detect the edge of the objects. So 
depending upon the threshold pixel the edges are accepted or rejected. The value of 
the threshold is selected based on the average of the tested training data set of 
image.",Python OpenCV
"Django bills itself as “the Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.” It
originated in the early 2000s, created by Web developers at the online presence of the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, which introduced it to the
world in 2005 as a way of “developing code with journalism deadlines.” We’ll
put ourselves on a deadline and see how fast we can produce a very simple
blog by using Django, and later do the same with Google App Engine.
(You’ll have to work on your perfectionist side on your own.) Although
we’re going to blast through this example, we’ll still give you enough in the
way of explanation so that you know what’s going on. However, if you
would like to explore a full treatment of this exact example, you’ll find it in
Chapter 2 of Python Web Development with Django (Addison-Wesley, 2009),
written by my esteemed colleagues, Jeff Forcier (lead developer of Fabric)
and Paul Bissex (creator of dpaste), plus yours truly.",Web development
"Installing Django
There are several ways of installing Django on your system, which are
listed here in increasing order of effort and/or complexity:
• Python package manager
• Operating system package manager
• Standard release tarball
• Source code repository
The simplest download and installation process takes advantage of
Python package management tools like easy_install from Setuptools
(http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html) or pip (http://
pip.openplans.org), both of which are available for all platforms. For Windows users with Setuptools, the easy_install.exe file should be installed
in the Scripts folder in which your Python distribution is located. You
only need to issue a single command; this is the command you would use
from a DOS Command window:",Web development
" Creating a Project in Django
Django comes with a utility called django-admin.py that can streamline
tasks such as the creation of the aforementioned project directories. On
POSIX platforms, it will usually be installed into directories such as /usr/
local/bin, /usr/bin, etc.; if you’re on a Windows-based computer, it goes
into the Scripts folder, which is directly in your Python installation folder,
e.g., C:\Python27\Scripts. For either POSIX computers or Windows computers, you should make sure that django-admin.py is in your PATH environment variable so that it can be executed from the command-line (unless
you like calling interpreters by using full pathnames).
For Windows computers, you will likely have to manually add
c:\python27 and c:\python27\scripts to your system PATH variable for
everything to work well (or whatever directory you installed Python in).
You do this by opening the Control Panel and then clicking System, or you
can right-click My Computer, and then choose Properties. From here,
select the Advanced tab, and then click the Environment Variables button.
You can choose to edit the PATH entry either for a single user (the top
listbox) or for all users (the bottom listbox), and then add ;c:\python27;c:\
python27\scripts after any text in the Variable value textbox. Some of
what you see appears in Figure 11-1.
Once your PATH is set (on either type of platform), you should be able
to run python and get an interactive interpreter and Django’s djangoadmin.py command to see its usage. You can test this by opening up a Unix
shell or DOS Command window and issuing those command names.
Once you’ve confirmed that everything is working, we can proceed.
The next step is to go to a directory or folder in which you want to place
your code. To create the project in the current working directory, issue the
following command (we’ll use a generic project name such as mysite, but
you can call it anything you wish):",Web development
"Using MySQL
With your (empty) database in place, all that remains is to instruct Django
on how to use it. This is where your project’s settings.py file comes in
(again). There are six potentially relevant settings here (though you might
need only two): ENGINE, NAME, HOST, PORT, USER, and PASSWORD. Their names
render their respective purposes pretty obvious. Just plug in the correct
values corresponding to the database server you’ll be using with Django.",Web development
"Using SQLite
SQLite is a popular choice for testing. It’s even a good candidate for
deployment in scenarios for which there isn’t a great deal of simultaneous
writing going on. No host, port, user, or password information is needed
because SQLite uses the local file system for storage and the native file
system permissions for access control—you can also choose a pure in-memory database. This is why our DATABASES configuration in settings.py
shown in the following code only has ENGINE and NAME when directing
Django to use your SQLite database.",Web development
" Creating the Tables
Now we need to instruct Django to use the connection information you’ve
given it to connect to the database and set up the tables that your application needs. You’ll use manage.py and its syncdb command, as demonstrated in the following sample execution",Web development
"The Django Administration App
The automatic back-end administration application, or admin for short, has
been described as Django’s crown jewel. For anyone who has tired of creating simple CRUD interfaces for Web applications, it’s a godsend. Admin
is an app that every Web site needs. Why? Well, you might want to confirm your app’s ability to insert a new record as well as update or delete it.
You understand that, but if your app hasn’t been completed yet, that
makes this a bit more difficult. The admin app solves this problem for you
by giving developers the ability to validate their data manipulation code
before the full UI has been completed",Web development

Now with the software we need in place, the time has come for the fun part–creating 
our first Django project!
If you recall from the Django installation section, we used a command called 
django-admin.py to test our installation. This utility is the heart of Django's project 
management facilities, as it enables the user to do a range of project management 
tasks, including these:
• Creating a new project
• Creating and managing the project's database
• Validating the current project and testing for errors
• Starting the development web server

"Flask is a Python web application micro-framework built on top of the Werkzeug WSGI library.
Flask may be ""micro"", but it’s ready for production use on a variety of needs.
The ""micro"" in micro-framework means Flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Flask
won’t make many decisions for you, such as what database to use, and the decisions that it does
make are easy to change. Everything is up to you, so that Flask can be everything you need and
nothing you don't.

appropriate for your requirements",Web development
"What is Flask?
Flask is a web application framework written in Python. It is developed by Armin Ronacher, 
who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco. Flask is based on the 
Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.
WSGI
Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) has been adopted as a standard for Python web 
application development. WSGI is a specification for a universal interface between the web 
server and the web applications. 
Werkzeug
It is a WSGI toolkit, which implements requests, response objects, and other utility functions. 
This enables building a web framework on top of it. The Flask framework uses Werkzeug as 
one of its bases.
Jinga2
Jinga2 is a popular templating engine for Python. A web templating system combines a 
template with a certain data source to render dynamic web pages.
Flask is often referred to as a micro framework. It aims to keep the core of an application 
simple yet extensible. Flask does not have built-in abstraction layer for database handling, 
nor does it have form a validation support. Instead, Flask supports the extensions to add such 
functionality to the application. Some of the popular Flask extensions are discussed later in 
the tutorial",Web development
"Creating Your 
First Flask Application
Flask is fun. This bold declaration is one of the first things you see when you view 
the official Flask documentation and, over the course of this book, you will come to 
understand why so many Python developers agree.

• Briefly discuss the features of the Flask framework
• Set up a development environment and install Flask
• Implement a minimal Flask app and analyze how it works
• Experiment with commonly used APIs and the interactive debugger
• Start working on the blog project that will be progressively enhanced over 
the course of the book

Python is the programming language which can be used for various purposes e.g. web design, mathematical
modeling, creating documents and game designs etc. In this chapter, we will review some of the basic features of
Python. Then, from next chapter we will write some good coding styles with advance features of Python.",Programming
" Pythonic Thinking
The idioms of a programming language are defined by its users. Over the years, the
Python community has come to use the adjective Pythonic to describe code that follows a
particular style. The Pythonic style isn’t regimented or enforced by the compiler. It has
emerged over time through experience using the language and working with others.
Python programmers prefer to be explicit, to choose simple over complex, and to
maximize readability (type import this).
Programmers familiar with other languages may try to write Python as if it’s C++, Java, or
whatever they know best. New programmers may still be getting comfortable with the vast
range of concepts expressible in Python. It’s important for everyone to know the best—the
Pythonic—way to do the most common things in Python. These patterns will affect every
program you write.",Programming

"The beginning of the modern Python programming started in December of
1989. The creator of this program was Guido van Rossum who began
programming as more of a hobby. At the time, van Rossum was working on a
project with the Dutch CWI research institute, that was later terminated. Van
Rossum was able to use some of the basics of this new language, known as the
ABC language, in order to work on Python.
The main strength of this language is that it is really easy to extend upon to
make more complex, or keep simple, and it was able to support multiple
platforms. Both of these were important during the days when personal
computers were becoming popular. And since Python was designed to
communicate with different file formats and libraries, it became a hit as well.
Python has grown quite a bit since its inception and more tools have been
added to make the programing more functioning.",Programming
"Python is a great program to use whether you are a beginner in the
programming world or you have been into it for some time. Many of those who
are just looking at getting started with programming will jump right in with
Python and make it their own. It is simple to understand and can be used by
anyone who is ready to get started with coding. This chapter is going to take
some time to explain some of the positives, as well as some of the drawbacks,
of using Python for your programming language",Programming
"he Pythonic Productivity Techniques section is another great resource. It covers aspects beyond the Python programming language,
and also includes tips on how to debug your programs, how to manage
the dependencies, and gives you a peek inside Python bytecode.
It truly is an honor and my pleasure to introduce this book, Python
Tricks, by my friend, Dan Bader.
By contributing to Python as a CPython core developer, I get connected to many members of the community. In my journey, I found
mentors, allies, and made many new friends. They remind me that
Python is not just about the code, Python is a community.
Mastering Python programming isn’t just about grasping the theoretical aspects of the language. It’s just as much about understanding and
adopting the conventions and best practices used by its community",Programming
" What’s a Python Trick?
Python Trick: A short Python code snippet meant as a
teaching tool. A Python Trick either teaches an aspect of
Python with a simple illustration, or it serves as a motivating example, enabling you to dig deeper and develop
an intuitive understanding.
Python Tricks started out as a short series of code screenshots that I
shared on Twitter for a week. To my surprise, they got rave responses
and were shared and retweeted for days on end.
More and more developers started asking me for a way to “get the
whole series.” Actually, I only had a few of these tricks lined up, spanning a variety of Python-related topics. There wasn’t a master plan
behind them. They were just a fun little Twitter experiment.
But from these inquiries I got the sense that my short-and-sweet code
examples would be worth exploring as a teaching tool. Eventually I set
out to create a few more Python Tricks and shared them in an email
series. Within a few days, several hundred Python developers had
signed up and I was just blown away by that response",Programming
"What Is JavaScript?
After completing this chapter, you will be able to
Understand JavaScript’s role in a webpage
Create a simple webpage
Create a JavaScript program
Welcome to the world of JavaScript programming. This book provides an introduction to Java Script programming both for the web and for Microsoft Windows 8. Like other books on JavaScript 
programming, this book shows the basics of how to create a program in JavaScript. However, unlike 
other introductory books on JavaScript, this book shows not only how something works but also why 
it works. If you’re looking merely to copy and paste JavaScript code into a webpage there are plenty 
of tutorials on the web to help solve those specific problems.
Beyond the basics of how and why things work as they do with JavaScript, the book also shows 
best practices for JavaScript programming and some of the real-world scenarios you’ll encounter as a 
JavaScript programmer. 
Programming for the web is different than programming in other languages or for other platforms. The JavaScript programs you write will run on the visitor’s computer. This means that when 
programming for the web, you have absolutely no control over the environment within which your 
program will run. 
While JavaScript has evolved over the years, not everyone’s computer has evolved along with 
it. The practical implication is that you need to account for the different computers and different 
situations on which your program might run. Your JavaScript program might find itself running on a 
computer from 1996 with Internet Explorer 5.5 through a dial-up modem just as easily as a shiny new 
computer running Internet Explorer 10 or the latest version of Firefox. Ultimately, this comes down to 
you, the JavaScript programmer, testing your programs in a bunch of different web browsers.
With that short introduction, it’s time to begin looking at JavaScript. The chapter begins with code. 
I’m doing this not to scare you away but to blatantly pander to the side of your brain that learns by 
seeing an example. After this short interlude, the chapter examines where JavaScript fits within the 
landscape of programming for the web and beyond. Then you’ll write your first JavaScript program.",Programming
"What is JavaScript?
Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most 
commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side 
script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted 
programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to 
JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript 
made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The 
general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet 
Explorer, and other web browsers.
The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript 
language.
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
Designed for creating network-centric applications.
Complementary to and integrated with Java.
Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
Open and cross-platform.
Client-Side JavaScript
Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should 
be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by 
the browser.
It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that 
interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI 
server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has 
entered a valid e-mail address in a form field",Programming
"Advantages of JavaScript
The merits of using JavaScript are:
 Less server interaction: You can validate user input before sending the page 
off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your 
server.
 Immediate feedback to the visitors: They don't have to wait for a page 
reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
 Increased interactivity: You can create interfaces that react when the user 
hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
 Richer interfaces: You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.",Programming
"WHAT JQUERY CAN DO FOR YOU
As presented in the last section, jQuery makes many tasks easier. Its simplistic, chainable, and comprehensive API has the capability to completely change the way you write JavaScript. With the goals 
of doing more with less code, jQuery really shines in the following areas:
➤ jQuery makes iterating and traversing the DOM much easier via its various built-in methods.
➤ jQuery makes selecting items from the DOM easier via its sophisticated, built-in, and ubiquitous capability to use selectors, just like you would use in CSS.
➤ jQuery makes it easy to add your own custom methods via its simple-to-understand plug-in 
architecture. 
➤ jQuery helps reduce redundancy in navigation and UI functionality, like tabs, CSS, and 
markup-based pop-up dialogs, animations, and transitions, and lots of other things.
Is jQuery the only JavaScript framework? No, certainly not. You can pick from several JavaScript 
frameworks: Yahoo UI, Prototype, SproutCore, Dojo, and so on. I like jQuery because I enjoy its 
simplicity and lack of verbosity. However, among the other frameworks, you’ll fi nd that there is a 
lot of similarity, and each provides its own advantages in terms of unifying Event APIs, providing 
sophisticated selector and traversal implementations, and providing simple interfaces for redundant 
JavaScript-driven UI tasks. Across the entire web, including websites that don’t use any JavaScript 
frameworks, jQuery can be found on as many as half of all websites. So, jQuery defi nitely has the 
benefi t of a ubiquitous, de facto standard. Based on its popularity, you’re extremely likely to run into 
other developers who have experience with and know how to use jQuery",Web development
"Since you’ve picked up a cookbook about jQuery, the authors of this book for the most
part are going to assume that you have a loose idea about what exactly jQuery is and
what it does. Frankly, cookbooks in general are typically written for an audience who
seeks to enhance a foundation of knowledge that has already been established. Thus,
the recipe-solution-discussion format is used to quickly get you solutions to common
problems. However, if you are a jQuery newbie, don’t throw this book against the wall
and curse us just yet. We’ve dedicated this chapter to you.
If you are in need of a review or are jumping into this cookbook with little or no working
knowledge of jQuery, this first chapter alone (the other chapters assume you know the
basics) will aid you in learning the jQuery essentials. Now, realistically, if you have
absolutely zero knowledge of JavaScript and the DOM, you might want to take a step
back and ask yourself whether approaching jQuery without a basic understanding of
the JavaScript core language and its relationship with the DOM is plausible. It would
be my recommendation to study up on the DOM and JavaScript core before approaching jQuery.",Web development
"Today's World Wide Web is a dynamic environment, and its users set a high bar for 
both style and function of sites. To build interesting, interactive sites, developers 
are turning to JavaScript libraries such as jQuery to automate common tasks and 
simplify complicated ones. One reason the jQuery library is a popular choice is its 
ability to assist in a wide range of tasks.
Because jQuery does perform so many different functions, it can seem challenging 
to know where to begin. Yet, there is a coherence and symmetry to the design of 
the library; most of its concepts are borrowed from the structure of HTML and 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Because many web developers have more experience 
with these technologies than with JavaScript, the library's design lends itself to a 
quick start for designers with little programming experience. In fact, in this opening 
chapter we'll write a functioning jQuery program in just three lines of code. On 
the other hand, experienced programmers will also be aided by this conceptual 
consistency, as we'll see in the later, more advanced chapters",Web development
"You probably spend more time in front of a computer than with your signifi cant other. Hence, 
having a nice comfortable seat, a fast computer, and software that accelerates development is 
essential. 
Starting with the basics, we’ll review requirements, different ways to obtain jQuery, and how 
to run it on both client and server, and set up some conventions for the rest of the book, using 
Google’s JavaScript standards.
In this chapter you set up your work environment for developing and debugging jQuery and 
JavaScript code. A major portion of development time goes into debugging, so a good debugger 
isn’t really an option. After reviewing Firebug, Chrome, and IE debuggers a portion of this chapter 
covers debugging JSON, tools for inspecting HTTP headers, and the JSLint code quality tool.
You learn to package your .js fi les for production use, explore tools, and establish some 
coding conventions",Web development
"Most of the services we enjoy on the Web are provided by web database applications. Web-based email, online shopping, forums and bulletin boards, corporate web
sites, and sports and news portals are all database-driven. To build a modern web
site, you need to develop a database application.
This book presents a highly popular, easy, low-cost way to bring together the Web
and databases to build applications. The most popular database management system used in these solutions is MySQL, a very fast and easy-to-use system distributed
under an Open Source license by its manufacturer, MySQL AB. We discuss MySQL
in detail in this book.
With a web server such as Apache (we assume Apache in this book, although the
software discussed here works with other web servers as well) and MySQL, you have
most of what you need to develop a web database application. The key glue you
need is a way for the web server to talk to the database; in other words, a way to
incorporate database operations into web pages. The most popular glue that accomplishes this task is PHP.
PHP is an open source project of the Apache Software Foundation and it’s the most
popular Apache web server add-on module, with around 53% of the Apache HTTP
servers having PHP capabilities.* PHP is particularly suited to web database applications because of its integration tools for the Web and database environments. In particular, the flexibility of embedding scripts in HTML pages permits easy integration
of HTML presentation and code. The database tier integration support is also excellent, with more than 15libraries available to interact with almost all popular database servers. In this book, we present a comprehensive view of PHP along with a
number of powerful extensions provided by a repository known as PEAR",Web development
"PHP began life as a way to manage a small personal website and was imagined and realized
by just one man, Ramsus Lerdorf. Originally dubbed Personal Home Page Tools, PHP quickly
evolved over the years from the basic scripting engine for a personal website into a highly
competitive, extremely robust code engine that is deployed on millions of websites across 
the globe. PHP’s fast, effective engine; its widespread, open-source developer base; and its
platform flexibility have all come together to create one of the world’s most effective online
scripting languages.
Throughout the years PHP has continued to improve on its foundations, providing
increased functionality and scalability. Because of PHP’s standard of listening to the community, fresh functionality is consistently added to every new release, allowing for more versatile
code and upgrades to its already substantial library of built-in methods. For years, people
have been using the PHP 4 series of code to create robust and powerful applications.
There is always room for improvement, however. Although PHP 4 is considered to be an
object-oriented programming (OOP) language, the class functionality found within it was not
entirely as flexible as some developers wanted it to be. Older OOP languages that have had
more time to grow have some strong functionality that PHP simply was not able to roll out in
its PHP 4 releases.
But that was then, and this is now. A very exciting occasion occurred for PHP developers
everywhere on July 13, 2004: PHP released its long-anticipated version 5. Sporting a new
object model powered by the already superb Zend II engine, PHP was ready to bring OOP 
to a new level with this release.
On top of new, more powerful class structures and functionality, PHP 5 has introduced
many exciting features, some of which the community has been clamoring about for ages. 
Say “hello (world)” to proper exception handling; new, simple-to-implement XML support;
more verbose Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) functionality for web services; and much,
much more.
This book will provide you with highly versatile recipes for improving and expanding
things with the new PHP 5 release. However, before we dive into that, in this chapter we will
give you a simple overview of what PHP can do, what is new with PHP 5, and how you can
apply these new concepts",Web development
"Why Learn Java? Why not C or C++?
• Java is the most widely taught programming language.
• Java is more popular
• Java is industrial strength used for large systems by large groups of people
• If you know Java learning C++ is easy.
Java is an enormous language. There are over 3700 different classes included in the Java 6 Standard

"jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library created by John Resig in 2006 with a nice
motto: Write less, do more. jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling,
animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is a JavaScript toolkit
designed to simplify various tasks by writing less code. Here is the list of important core
features supported by jQuery:
 DOM manipulation: The jQuery made it easy to select DOM elements, negotiate them
and modifying their content by using cross-browser open source selector engine called
Sizzle.
 Event handling: The jQuery offers an elegant way to capture a wide variety of events,
such as a user clicking on a link, without the need to clutter the HTML code itself with
event handlers.
 AJAX Support: The jQuery helps you a lot to develop a responsive and feature-rich
site using AJAX technology.
 Animations: The jQuery comes with plenty of built-in animation effects which you can
use in your websites.",Web development
"AJAX, one of the hottest technology combinations to enter the Web development landscape 
in years, has fueled a surge in interactive Web design with 
its ability to load new content into an existing DOM structure.
jQuery simplifies using AJAX with several shorthand methods 
for the basic AJAX methods. For most developers and designers, 
these shorthand methods will be all that they ever need to use. 
The jQuery AJAX shorthand methods post, get, and load are 
featured in this chapter. jQuery also provides a robust feature set, 
including callbacks, for developers who want to customize their 
AJAX calls to provide richer interactive experiences. I’ll show you 
how to use several of jQuery’s AJAX features to enhance Web sites 
and applications. Let’s start by completing the form validation 
that you started in Chapter",Web development
"JavaScript Meets HTML with the DOM
Although this discussion is about JavaScript and its evolution, it’s the DOM (which has evolved
immensely from its early days) that takes center stage in the browser. Netscape, back in version 2 when JavaScript was invented, enabled you to access form and image elements. When
IE version 3 was released, it mimicked how Netscape did things to compete and not have
pages appear broken.
As the version 4 browsers were released, both browsers tried to expand their capabilities
by enabling ways to interact with more of the page; in particular, to position and move elements around the page. Each browser approached things in different and proprietary ways,
causing plenty of headaches.
The W3C developed its first DOM recommendation as a way to standardize the
approach that all browsers took, making it easier for developers to create functionality that
worked across all browsers—just like the HTML recommendations. The W3C DOM offered
the hope of interactivity with the full HTML (and XML) documents with the capability to add
and remove elements via JavaScript. The DOM Level 1 recommendation is fairly well supported across Mozilla and IE 5+. 
The W3C has subsequently come out with versions 2 and 3 of the DOM recommendations, which continue to build on the functionality defined in level 1. (Differences between the
DOM versions are covered in Chapter 2.)",Web development
"JavaScript frameworks have arisen as necessary and useful companions for client-side web development. Without JavaScript frameworks, client-side programming becomes a crater-filled minefield of cross-browser, cross-platform inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies. JavaScript frameworks pave over those craters and inconsistencies to create a seamless, enjoyable client-side programming experience. The most important hole filled by a JavaScript framework is inconsistencies between Internet Explorer’s and the W3C’s standard Event APIs. jQuery fills in this hole by making a cross-browser Event API that is very similar to the W3C’s, adding some original helpful extensions of its own. Another hole filled by most of the popular client-side JavaScript frameworks is the ability to select and traverse through nodes in the Document Object Model (DOM) using more than the very remedial selection and traversal APIs that are provided by browsers’ default DOM implementations. jQuery provides a selection mechanism that uses selector syntax like that used in cascading style sheets. However, not content to support only the standard selectors supported in CSS and even the new Selectors API implementations supported by WebKit and Internet Explorer 8, jQuery again extends the standard to support new, innovative, and useful selectors that make sense when using selectors to select DOM nodes. In a nutshell, jQuery reduces significantly the amount of JavaScript programming and Q/A (quality assurance) you have to undertake. It takes what might take several lines of code to write, and more often than not reduces that to just one or a few lines of code. jQuery makes your JavaScript more intuitive and easier to understand. jQuery takes JavaScript programming (which at one time had a higher barrier of entry due to complexity and cross-browser, cross-platform idiosyncrasies) and makes it easier and more attractive to average web developers",Web development
"What Does jQuery Do for Me?
jQuery makes many tasks easier. Its simplistic, comprehensive API has the ability to completely change 
the way you write JavaScript, with the aim of consolidating and eliminating as many common and 
redundant tasks as possible. jQuery really shines in the following areas:
jQuery makes iterating and traversing the DOM much easier via its various built-in methods for 
doing the same.
jQuery makes selecting items from the DOM easier via its sophisticated, built-in ability to use 
selectors, just like you would use in CSS.
jQuery makes it really easy to add your own custom methods via its simple-to-understand 
plug-in architecture. 
jQuery helps reduce redundancy in navigation and UI functionality, like tabs, CSS and markup based pop-up dialogues, animations, and transitions, and lots of other things.",Web development
"JavaScript is now part of an overall development methodology, which means that you develop it not to interfere 
with other technologies like HTML or CSS, but to interact with them or complement them.
Web development has come quite a way since the 1990s, and there is not much sense in creating web sites that 
are static and fixed in size. Any modern web design should allow for growth as needed. It should also be accessible to 
everyone (which does not mean that everybody gets the same appearance—a nice multicolumn layout, for example, 
might make sense on a high-resolution monitor but is hard to use on a mobile phone or a tablet)—and ready for 
internationalization. You cannot afford any longer to build something and think it’ll last forever. Because the Web is 
about content and change, it’ll become obsolete if we don’t upgrade our web products constantly and allow other 
data sources to feed into it or get information from it",Web development
"Once we’ve got the set of wrapped elements that we either identified by using a 
selector to match existing DOM elements or created as new elements using HTML
snippets (or a combination of both), we’re ready to manipulate those elements 
using the powerful set of jQuery commands. We’ll start looking at those commands in the next chapter; but what if we’re not quite ready yet? What if we want 
to further refine the set of elements wrapped by the jQuery function?
 In this section, we’ll explore the many ways that we can refine, extend, or subset the set of wrapped elements that we wish to operate upon.",Web development

The CPU communicates with memory and I/O devices by placing a 
numeric value on the address bus to select one of the memory locations or 
I/O device port locations, each of which has a unique binary numeric address. 
Then the CPU, memory, and I/O devices pass data among themselves by 
placing the data on the data bus. The control bus contains signals that

"First, Supervised Learning is a lot similar to learning from examples. For
instance, we have a huge collection of images correctly labeled as either dogs or
cats. Our computer will then learn from those given examples and correct labels.
Perhaps our computer will find patterns and similarities among those images.
And finally when we introduce new images, our computer and model will
successfully identify an image whether there’s a dog or cat in it.
It’s a lot like learning with supervision. There are correct answers (e.g. cats or
dogs) and it’s the job of our model to align itself so on new data it can still
produce correct answers (in an acceptable performance level because it’s hard to
reach 100%).
For example, Linear Regression is considered under Supervised Learning.
Remember that in linear regression we’re trying to predict the value of y for a
given x. But first, we have to find patterns and “fit” a line that best describes the
relationship between x and y (and predict y values for new x inputs).",machine learning
"In contrast, Unsupervised Learning means there’s no supervision or guidance.
It’s often thought of as having no correct answers, just acceptable ones.
For example, in Clustering (this falls under Unsupervised Learning) we’re trying
to discover where data points aggregate (e.g. are there natural clusters?). Each
data point is not labeled anything so our model and computer won’t be learning
from examples. Instead, our computer is learning to identify patterns without any
external guidance.
This seems to be the essence of true Artificial Intelligence wherein the computer
can learn without human intervention. It’s about learning from the data itself and
trying to find the relationship between different inputs (notice there’s no
expected output here in contrast to Regression and Classification discussed
earlier). The focus is on inputs and trying to find the patterns and relationships
among them. Perhaps there are natural clusters or there are clear associations
among the inputs. It’s also possible that there’s no useful relationship at all.",Machine learning
"Simple Linear Regression
Here we’ll be dealing with one independent variable and one dependent. Later
on we’ll be dealing with multiple variables and show how can they be used to
predict the target (similar to what we talked about predicting something based on
several features/attributes)",machine learning
" Classification
Spam or not spam? This is one of the most popular uses and examples of
Classification. Just like Regression, Classification is also under Supervised
Learning. Our model learns from labelled data (“with supervision”). Then, our
system applies that learning to new dataset.
For example, we have a dataset with different email messages and each one was
labelled either Spam or Not Spam. Our model might then find patterns or
commonalities among email messages that are marked Spam. When performing
a prediction, our model might try to find those patterns and commonalities in
new email messages.
There are different approaches in doing successful Classification. Let’s discuss a
few of them:
Logistic Regression
In many Classification tasks, the goal is to determine whether it’s 0 or 1 using
two independent variables. For example, given that the Age and Estimated
Salary determine an outcome such as when the person purchased or not, how can
we successfully create a model that shows their relationships and use that for
prediction",machine learning
"K-Nearest Neighbors
Notice that Logistic Regression seems to have a linear boundary between 0s and
1s. As a result, it misses a few of the data points that should have been on the
other side.
Thankfully, there are non-linear models that can capture more data points in a
more accurate manner. One of them is through the use of K-Nearest Neighbors.
It works by having a “new data point” and then counting how many neighbors
belong to either category. If more neighbors belong to category A than category
B, then the new point should belong to category A.",machine learning
"Decision Tree Classification
As with Regression, many data scientists also implement Decision Trees in
Classification. As mentioned in the previous chapter, creating a decision tree is
about breaking down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while branching
them out (creating an associated decision tree).",machine learning
"Taxonomy of machine learning 
algorithms
The purpose of machine learning is to teach computers to execute tasks without 
human intervention. An increasing number of applications such as genomics, social 
networking, advertising, or risk analysis generate a very large amount of data that 
can be analyzed or mined to extract knowledge or provide insight into a process, 
a customer, or an organization. Ultimately, machine learning algorithms consist 
of identifying and validating models to optimize a performance criterion using 
historical, present, and future data",machine learning
"Clustering
The purpose of data clustering is to partition a collection of data into a number of 
clusters or data segments. Practically, a clustering algorithm is used to organize 
observations into clusters by minimizing the observations within a cluster and 
maximizing the observations between clusters. A clustering algorithm consists 
of the following steps:
1. Creating a model by making an assumption on the input data.
2. Selecting the objective function or goal of the clustering.
3. Evaluating one or more algorithms to optimize the objective function.
Data clustering is also known as data segmentation or data partitioning",machine learning
"Dimension reduction
Dimension reduction techniques aim at finding the smallest but most relevant set 
of features that models dataset reliability. There are many reasons for reducing the 
number of features or parameters in a model, from avoiding overfitting to reducing 
computation costs.
There are many ways to classify the different techniques used to extract knowledge 
from data using unsupervised learning. The following taxonomy breaks down these 
techniques according to their purpose, although the list is far for being exhaustive, as 
shown in the following diagram:",machine learning
"Rogue certificates are valid certificates issued by a legitimate certificate authority (CA) that are nonetheless
untrustworthy; yet trusted by web browsers and users. With the current public key infrastructure, there
exists a window of vulnerability between the time a rogue certificate is issued and when it is detected. Rogue
certificates from recent compromises have been trusted for as long as weeks before detection and revocation.
Previous proposals to close this window of vulnerability require changes in the infrastructure, Internet
protocols, or end user experience. We present a method for detecting rogue certificates from trusted CAs
developed from a large and timely collection of certificates. This method automates classification by building
machine-learning models with Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Despite the scarcity of rogue instances in
the dataset, DNN produced a classification method that is proven both in simulation and in the July 2014
compromise of the India CCA. We report the details of the classification method and illustrate that it is
repeatable, such as with datasets obtained from crawling. We describe the classification performance under
our current research deployment",deep learning

"For the examples in this book, we'll use a particular programming language,
called Python. I chose Python for several reasons. It's a language that's in
common use today for producing many different kinds of software. It's
available for most computers that you're likely to use. And it's a clean and
well-designed language: for the most part, the way you express things in Python
is straightforward, with a minimum of extraneous words and punctuation. I

"SQLite3 can be integrated with Python using sqlite3 module, which was written by Gerhard 
Haring. It provides an SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described 
by PEP 249. You do not need to install this module separately because it is shipped by 
default along with Python version 2.5.x onwards.
To use sqlite3 module, you must first create a connection object that represents the 
database and then optionally you can create a cursor object, which will help you in 
executing all the SQL statements.
Python sqlite3 module APIs
Following are important sqlite3 module routines, which can suffice your requirement to 
work with SQLite database from your Python program. If you are looking for a more 
sophisticated application, then you can look into Python sqlite3 module's official

you are probably using a Unix-based operating system such as Mac OS X or Linux. It makes 
sense to develop with Django on Unix-based platforms because the websites will most likely 
be published on a Linux Server later, so you can establish routines that work the same while 
developing as while deploying. If you are working with Django locally on Windows, the routines 
are similar, but not always exactly the same",Web development

"What is Django?
Django is a free open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-template(MVT)
architectural pattern. It is maintained by Django Software Foundation(DSF). Django’s primary goal is to ease
the creation of complex, database-driven websites.
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on
writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.",Web development
